## FiveM MultiFramework Custom mining script by me from scratch

- Highly customisable via `locations.lua`
  - Locations are easily changeable/removable

- Features several ways to get materials
  - Gold Panning - Search specified streams for gold and silver, or trash
  - Mining - Mine to get stones that can be wash or cracked for materials
  - Stone Washing - Wash stone to find rare gems or gold
  - Stone Cracking - Crack open stones to find ores for crafting materials

- Customisable points for mining, stone cracking and gold panning
  - Add a Location for an ore to the config and it will use this location for both qb-target and a prop
  - Can place them anywhere, doesn't have to be just one mining location
  - I opted for a drilling animation as opposed to the pickaxe swinging
  - Nicely animated for better immersion

- NPC's spawn on the blip locations
  - These locations can also give third eye and select ones have context menus for selling points

- NPC's and ore's Spawn at Mineshaft + Quarry so your players can go to either

- Features simplistic built in crafting that uses recipes in the config.lua

- Features Jewel Cutting bench as an attempt to add more than just gold bars and such to sell
  - You can use your gold bars and jewels to craft other items to sell to a Jewellery Buyer
